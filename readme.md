## Scripts

### Get list of files

Take advantage of Windows Desktop Search and very fast, get the list
of MS Access applications present on the computer (local drives so
also return files present, f.i. on a D: drive if you run the script
from the C: drive; don't scan network drives).

Just adjust the searched extension for searching for any other type 
of files like .docx, .png, .xlsx, ...

This script is really, really fast but only works for local drives.
